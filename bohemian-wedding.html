        guest table unlike any other. It is colorful and playful, full of many
        aromatic and whimsical designs. Arrange your flowers in a way that
        enhances your overall theme with added unusual sweets such as chocolate

        In the spirit of a bohemian and playful wedding, your voes can be just
        as visually romatic set against a wooden arch adorned with whimsical
        flowers and many other items in the theme of wooden tables and chairs,
        the softness in the presentation is a key factor. - Taken from Elegant
